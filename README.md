Hash Table for Personal Details:

Implements a hash table to store and retrieve details of individuals such as name, phone number, and address.
Uses a simple hashing function to convert names into table indices and supports insertion and search operations.
Call Logs Management Using Binary Search Tree:

Utilizes a binary search tree to manage and display call logs in chronological order.
Allows insertion of call details and displays them using an inorder traversal of the tree.
Notification Management:

Stack Implementation: Manages notifications using a stack data structure to display notifications in the latest-first order.
Linked List Implementation: Stores and displays notifications from different applications using a linked list, providing the ability to search and view specific notifications based on an identifier.
Key Features:
Hash Table: For quick lookup of personal details.
Binary Search Tree: For sorting and displaying call logs based on the time of the call.
Stack: For handling and displaying the most recent notifications.
Linked List: For managing notifications from various applications with the ability to search for specific ones.
Usage:
The user can add and view personal details, manage call logs, and handle notifications through different data structures, demonstrating an understanding of hash tables, binary search trees, stacks, and linked lists.
This project showcases the integration of various data structures to handle and manage different types of data efficiently.
